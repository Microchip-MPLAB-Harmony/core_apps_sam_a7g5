## Code Examples

The following applications are provided to demonstrate the typical or interesting usage models of one or more peripheral libraries.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [I2C driver asynchronous - I2C EEPROM](apps/driver/i2c/async/i2c_eeprom/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM |
| [I2C driver synchronous - I2C EEPROM](apps/driver/i2c/sync/i2c_eeprom/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in synchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM |
| [I2C EEPROM AT24 driver - EEPROM Read Write](apps/driver/i2c_eeprom/at24/at24_eeprom_read_write/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the AT24 driver to perform read and write operations on AT24 series of EEPROM |
| [SPI Driver asynchronous - multi client](apps/driver/spi/async/spi_multi_slave/readme.md) | This example demonstrates how to use single instance of the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to communicate with multiple EEPROMs |
| [SPI Driver synchronous - multi client](apps/driver/spi/sync/spi_multi_slave/readme.md) | This example demonstrates how to use single instance of the SPI driver in synchronous mode to communicate with multiple EEPROMs in an RTOS environment |
| [SPI EEPROM AT25 driver - EEPROM Read Write](apps/driver/spi_eeprom/at25/at25_eeprom_read_write/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the AT25 driver to perform read and write operations on AT25 series of EEPROM |
| [USART driver asynchronous - USART echo](apps/driver/usart/async/usart_echo/readme.md) | This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode |
| [USART driver synchronous - USART echo](apps/driver/usart/sync/usart_echo/readme.md) | This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in synchronous mode |
| [FAT filesystem using SDMMC Media](apps/fs/sdmmc_fat/readme.md) | This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access and modify the contents of a SD card using the SDMMC driver |
| [FreeRTOS basic](apps/rtos/freertos/basic_freertos/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates context switching between four tasks of different priorites. Two tasks run periodically while the other two tasks are event driven |
| [Time System Service multi-client](apps/system/time/sys_time_multiclient/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates the multi-client system timer functionality |
